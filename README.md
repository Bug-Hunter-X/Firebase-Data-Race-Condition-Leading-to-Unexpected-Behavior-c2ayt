This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Firebase: a data race condition when accessing data before it's fully loaded from the database. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code that causes the unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected approach using promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations correctly.  This ensures the application waits for data to load before accessing it.
